Since 2014, I’m a digital media producer at [Nordiska museet](http://www.nordiskamuseet.se/en) in Stockholm, Sweden. In my work I'm involved in multiple projects at the museum; both web-based projects and on-site digital interactives.

I'm the editor in chief of [Utställningskritik](https://utstallningskritik.se), beginning in 2022.

Between 2003 and 2014, I worked in various positions at the [Nobel Museum](http://www.nobelmuseum.se/en) (also in Stockholm), mainly with exhibitions and digital media. In 2011–2012, I had a temporary position as web project manager at the [National Maritime Museums in Sweden](http://www.maritima.se/en/).

I started the blog on this site after participating in the [2012 Museums and the Web](http://www.museumsandtheweb.com/mw2012.html) conference in San Diego, CA. Connecting with the international museum tech community was an eye-opener to the vast variety of digital initiatives taking place all around the world. I've had the luxury to participate in and [present my work](/presentations) at multiple museum conferences and seminars in Sweden and abroad.
