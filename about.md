Beginning in August 2014, I am a digital media producer at [Nordiska museet](http://www.nordiskamuseet.se/en) in Stockholm, Sweden. Between 2003 and 2014, I worked in various positions at the [Nobel Museum](http://www.nobelmuseum.se/en) (also in Stockholm), mainly with exhibitions and digital media. In 2011â€“2012, I had a temporary position as web project manager at the [National Maritime Museums in Sweden](http://www.maritima.se/en/).

I started the blog on this site after participating in the [2012 Museums and the Web](http://www.museumsandtheweb.com/mw2012.html) conference in San Diego, CA. Connecting with the international museum tech community was an eye-opener to the vast variety of digital initiatives taking place all around the world, and I have tried since then to contribute my own thoughts and experiences (although at a sometimes horribly slow pace).

You can find me on [@AronAmbrosiani](https://twitter.com/AronAmbrosiani) (museum-related tweets in Swedish and English) or at [{{site.email}}](mailto:{{site.email}}).
