Regarding my [last post](/2012/05/06/what-can-curators-learn-from-coders/), here’s a [case study](http://uxmag.com/articles/iterating-for-visitors-at-the-exploratorium) by Eric Socolofsky, New Media Exhibit Developer at the Exploratorium, of what I was actually aiming for: trying out your exhibits with a live audience.

In other news, this blog was put on hold for a while by the arrival of my beautiful, charming and basically perfect daughter (now approaching five months of age). I’m currently working two days a week and being on parental leave three days a week, so expect more blog posts in the near future.
