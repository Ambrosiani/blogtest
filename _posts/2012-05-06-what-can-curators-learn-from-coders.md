I think there is a fundamental difference between old-school exhibitions on one side and agile web development on the other.

The exhibition process basically goes like this:

1. plan the exhibition (behind closed doors)
2. produce the exhibition (behind closed doors)
3. build the exhibition (behind closed doors)
4. Done! Then: open exhibition to the public.

While the typical agile web project is more like this:

1. Plan the web experience (behind closed doors)
2. Build prototype/beta (behind closed doors)
3. Open the web to the public.
4. Test & analyze, then go to step 1

or, more generalized:

curating:

1. build
2. launch

web:

1. launch
2. build & repeat

The difficulty with involving curators in digital media is, in my personal experience, that they feel quite uncomfortable to do the “curating” in public, letting the audience see & try out the unfinished projects. Also, they feel dissatisfied that you cannot “close the book” and finish a project, but that web pages require continuous attention. This also identifies the main problem with most “web exhibitions” produced so far – they are static products, permanent presentations. In comparison with the surrounding web – interactive, ever-changing – they feel a bit dull and misplaced and would often fit better into a book format. The exhibition web often happens to be the exhibition catalogue, with added multimedia.

As a curator myself, I have grappled with these problem and think that a solution might be found in actually revising “finished” exhibitions, to continue to edit them, let visitor interactions become part of the exhibition, etc. I think communication is changing towards more dialogue and less broadcasting, without losing the authority of the museum voice.

A big problem, though, is that agile development is quite hard to achieve within the framework of Swedish governmental authorities. To avoid corruption and streamline the [procurement process](http://avropa.se/sv-SE/Om-inkopscentralen/In-English/), we have to make detailed requirement specifications for every project of a particular size, and then offer the project to a selected shortlist of vendors/suppliers – that is, extremely “inagile”. (Note to the reader: I am quite new in this government-run museum world, and I suppose there are ways to do this procurement efficiently without having to plan an entire project start to end. Please let me know!)

You Swedish curators out there – does this feel familiar? Is there something to learn from the coders, or am I on the wrong track here?
