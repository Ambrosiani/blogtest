Thanks to the [Swedish Exhibition Agency](http://www.riksutstallningar.se/), I was able to visit the conference [Museums and the Web](http://www.museumsandtheweb.com/mw2012), held this April in San Diego. Four days of inspiring workshops, seminars and unconference sessions later, my brain was buzzing with feedback, theories and concrete ideas to test. I started out this last Friday with a talk for my colleagues and this is step 2: a blog (yet another) about museums in the new digital age.

More specifically, I will touch on subjects that I encounter in my position as web project manager at the Swedish National Maritime Museums. The main aims of our websites – [Vasamuseet.se](http://www.vasamuseet.se/en/), [Sjohistoriska.se](http://www.sjohistoriska.se/en/), [Marinmuseum.se](http://www.marinmuseum.se/en/) – are of course to promote the physical museums to potential visitors, but they are continually being redefined as an extension of the museum experience itself. The websites are displayed inside museum exhibitions to enhance and augment the visit in different ways. I wish to discuss the opportunities and the problems in this approach to the museum web, and to share our particular solutions to a professional audience.

Posts will be in English to start with, perhaps with some Swedish mixed in… welcome aboard!

best regards,
Aron
